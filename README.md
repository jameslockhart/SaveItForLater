# SaveItForLater

iOS app written with swift that syncs with a firebase datastore to display a list of links saved from the save it for later google chrome extension.

Currently only opens the webpage. If the app is installed, Youtube for example,  it will push you into the app and video. More support coming to directly open the application via app links

Support coming for sharing from apps to SaveIt

To build:
1] Run pod install and open the xcworkspace file
2] Create a firebase account
3] Add the google plist file to the project
4] Build and run
